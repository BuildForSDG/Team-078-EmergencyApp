1 - I created a folder called components, where all our menu components will be resided
all other components can be created here. To make our work neat, a subfolder(custome component) 
is created for each of the user (admin, victim, respondant), this pertern was used for our pages.

2 - A file called 'victim.components.module.ts (shared module) is created, this file allows us 
to share component among components. Here we are sharing component for our menu for various pages

3. To be able to  use features provided by Angular and Ionic, Modules provided by ionic and Angular
were imported into sshared module. For example if Ionic module is not imported, ionic extentended elements will 
not work and this could break our application.

4. In other to make our custom component sharable, I imported the custom component into the shared module

Created indidual components and shared component for all the parents folders (admin, victim, respondant).
The essence of creating this was, each user has his own menu designed differently, 
hence, this gives us the berty to design each menu differently, the pages are grouped 
(Admin, respondants and victim), all this pages has a sub-folder for individual page.

2. I imported NgModule, BrowserModule IonicModule and IonicRouteStrategy into this give us our component 
to use modules provided by Angular and Ionic.

3 I imported each menu component which are two steps upward i.e that are two steps to their parent folder

4. Imported Individual component into their respective module
